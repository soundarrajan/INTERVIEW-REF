1.    SOLID Principle.

In the realm of object-oriented software design, 
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software more 
understandable, flexible, and maintainable. 

A. S - Single Resposibility : A class should have only one reason to change,
 meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

    A class should be responsible for one, and only one, aspect of a program's functionality.
    This responsibility should be encapsulated entirely within that class.
    If a class has more than one reason to change, it has more than one responsibility.

B. O - Opened/Closed: open for extension but closed for modification.
Angularâ€™s features such as components, services, dependency injection, and directives, 
you can design your application in a way that adheres to the Open/Closed Principle.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. This means creating specific interfaces rather than a general-purpose one.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
