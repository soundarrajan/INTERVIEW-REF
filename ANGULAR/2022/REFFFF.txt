DATA BINDING:
Data binding automatically keeps your page up-to-date based on your application's state.
Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view. 
When data in the model changes, the view reflects the change, and when data in the view changes, the model is updated as well.

html attributes, dom properties:

<button disabled="false">Still Disabled</button>.
<input [disabled]="condition ? true : false">
