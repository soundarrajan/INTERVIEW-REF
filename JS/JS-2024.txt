lexical env:

When a function is defined, it captures its surrounding environment,
 which includes any variables and functions that are in scope at the time of the function's definition. 
 This captured environment is known as the lexical environment.
  When the function is later invoked, it still has access to this environment,
   even if it is called outside its original scope.
------------------
JS is single thread. how to make multi:

This means it has one call stack and one memory heap, 
and it executes code in a sequential, synchronous manner.

MULTI THREADING:
1. CALLBACKS - SETTIMEOUT, setInterval
2. promises

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

3. async/await.

async function fetchData() {
    try {
        let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        let data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}
fetchData();
------------
Event loop mechanism:

1. call stack. - Where the synchronous code is executed.
When a function is called, it's added to the top of the stack, and when it completes, 
    it's removed from the stack.

2. web api - Provided by the browser (or Node.js), these handle asynchronous operations like setTimeout, 
fetch, etc.

3. call back queue - Where callbacks of completed asynchronous operations are queued.

4. Microtask Queue: This queue holds microtasks like promises. 
Microtasks are processed immediately after the currently executing script and 
before the event loop continues with the next task in the callback queue.

5. event loop. - Continuously checks the call stack and the callback queue. 
If the call stack is empty, it pushes the first callback from the queue to the call stack for execution.

order of execution:

1, synchronus code
2. micro task - promise, fetch
3. macrotask - setTimeout, setInterval

Microtasks have higher priority compared to macro tasks
-----------------
stack:
function first() {
    console.log("First function starts");
    second();
    console.log("First function ends");
}

function second() {
    console.log("Second function starts");
    third();
    console.log("Second function ends");
}

function third() {
    console.log("Third function starts and ends");
}

first();

Call Stack Execution

Global Execution Context:

first() is called.
first function execution context is created and pushed onto the stack.
Stack:
first()

Inside first Function:
console.log("First function starts") executes.
second() is called.

second function execution context is created and pushed onto the stack.
Stack:
second()
first()

Inside second Function:
console.log("Second function starts") executes.
third() is called.
third function execution context is created and pushed onto the stack.

Stack:
third()
second()
first()
Inside third Function:
console.log("Third function starts and ends") executes.
third function execution context is popped off the stack.

Stack:
second()
first()

Back to second Function:
console.log("Second function ends") executes.
second function execution context is popped off the stack.

Stack:
first()

Back to first Function:
console.log("First function ends") executes.
first function execution context is popped off the stack.
Stack:
empty
_________
First function starts
Second function starts
Third function starts and ends
Second function ends
First function ends
-----------------
why promise is micro task

1. execute their callbacks asynchronously and immediately.
2. non - blocking code

Promises are microtasks in JavaScript because they are designed to execute their callbacks asynchronously 
but as soon as possible, immediately after the current task and any microtasks that preceded them. 
This ensures a non-blocking, efficient handling of asynchronous operations, 
fitting perfectly within the event loop's microtask queue mechanism.

promise:
1. asyn operation.
2. it has 3 states: pending, fulfilled, rejected

Definition: Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and 
allow you to handle its result asynchronously.
Usage: Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks. 
They allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations and handle success and error cases separately.


starts with pending state, then transition moved to fulfiiled (success) or
rejected(fails)

.then, .catch methods used to  handle resolved value or reason for pending.
   ----------------
    let myPromise = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            let success = true;
            if(success){
                resolve('success');
            }else{
                reject('fail')
            }
        },2000)
    });
    
    myPromise.then((msg) => {
        console.log(msg);
    }) .catch((error) => {
       console.log(error); 
    });
----------------------------------------------
ASYNC/AWAIT

    // Simulate multiple asynchronous functions
async function fetchData1() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data 1 fetched"), 1000);
  });
}

async function fetchData2() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data 2 fetched"), 2000);
  });
}

// Function that processes multiple data fetches
async function processMultiple() {
  try {
    const data1 = await fetchData1();
    console.log(data1);

    const data2 = await fetchData2();
    console.log(data2);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}

processMultiple();

Using async/await with try/catch makes it easier to handle errors and manage asynchronous operations 
in a clean and readable manner, which is particularly beneficial for complex applications with 
multiple asynchronous tasks.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Define the API endpoint
const apiUrl = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts';

// Define the data to be sent
const postData = {
  title: 'foo',
  body: 'bar',
  userId: 1,
};

// Make the API call using fetch
fetch(apiUrl, {
  method: 'POST', // Specify the request method
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json', // Set the content type to JSON
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(postData), // Convert the data to JSON string
})
  .then(response => {
    // Check if the response is successful
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok ' + response.statusText);
    }
    // Parse the JSON from the response
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    // Handle the data from the API
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle any errors that occurred during the fetch
    console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error);
  });
