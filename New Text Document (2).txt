Hi Team,

Set upstream on your fork design system. (One time)

Use the following three commends.

 

1.       git remote –v

(console-output)

origin  https://inatech.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Inatech-UI-Development/_git/Design-System-Gokul (fetch)

origin  https://inatech.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Inatech-UI-Development/_git/Design-System-Gokul (push)

 

2.       git remote add upstream https://inatech.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Inatech-UI-Development/_git/Design-System

 

3.       git remote –v
